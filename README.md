======

playground for writing code using GO

To run compiled code in /bin, add code location to GOPATH and PATH
- export GOPATH=/your-dir-for-code
- export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
- cd your-dir-for-code/bin
- hello

To run source code as a test, just type 'go run'. Ex:
- cd src/github.com/klasalvia/hello_channel
- go run hello_channel.go
